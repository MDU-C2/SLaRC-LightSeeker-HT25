## 1. Introduction 
Welcome to the SLaRC UGV user guide. This document will help you to set up, use, and troubleshoot the UGV platform.

**Who is this for?**
<br> This guide is intended for new users, technicians and administrators.

## 2. System Overview
The platform is a Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) and is a part of the SLaRC project. ...

### 1. Bill of Materials

### 2. Mechanical Design
<!-- e.g. solidwork, images of platform/sensors-->

### 3. Power System 
<!-- e.g. How the PDB is designed and all it functions, all other components-->
#### 1. Battery
The UGV is powered by two Li-Po batteries. The platform can be driven by either one och two batteries at the same time. This gives the user the opportunity to charge one battery while still using the platform. 

Specs:
Capacity: 22000mAh,
Voltage: 44.4V,
Discharge Rate: 25C,
Weight: 6058g,
Size: 237*173*116mm

WARNING: Lithium-Polymer (LiPo) batteries can be dangerous if mishandled. Failure to follow these safety instructions may result in fire, explosion, personal injury, or damage to equipment.

General Safety: 

- Always read and follow safety intructions before use. 
- 

Charging:
- Always use the intened charger for the specific battery.
- Never charge the battery unattended. 
- Inspect the battery from swelling, damage and torn cabled before use. Never charge the battery if any damage is identified. 

Handling and Operation:
- Do not short-cut the terminals.
- Never expose the battery for heat, direct sunlight, water or mechanical shock.
- Be careful not to crush or pierce the battery pack.

Storage:
- When the platfrom is not used, store the batteries in the intended safe-battery cabinet at C2 (building 326 at finslätten).

In Case of Fire:
- Use the intended lithium fire extinguisher for battery fire avalible at C2 (building 326 at finslätten). 

#### 2. Main Switch

The UGV:S main switch is located at the back of the platform. Its main purpose is to disconnect/open the ciurcut from the battery to the rest of the circuit. The two states is ON (green field), and OFF (red field).

## 3. Platform Features
<!-- e.g. reqirements or functions that the device can perform -->
### 1. Battery Charging

### 2. Main Switch
The platfrom is equipted with a main switch with the purpose of disconnect/open the circuit from the battery to the rest of the circuit. 

#### 1. Open the circuit:
Turn the knob clockwise to the green ON position


### 3. Emergency Stop

### 4. Add/remove sensors to the PDB

### 5. Change Output Voltage on PDB



## 4. Hardware Setup
<!-- e.g. step by step how to set up something-->

## 5. Software Installation
<!-- e.g. step by step how to install or do something -->

## 6. Troubleshooting
<!-- e.g. Issue. UGV Fails to respond to commands. -->

## 7. Support & Contact
<!-- e.g. a list of all students in the SLaRC team and what role they had/what knowledge they possessed about-->
